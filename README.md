# No Arena in Chinatown: Learning from a Lost Community
Tori Beck  
Interactive data visualization for CAPP 30239

# Description
This project compares demographic shifts between Washington DC's Chinatown and  
Philadelphia's Chinatown in the midst of conversations about building a basektball  
arena near the border of Philadelphia's Chinatown.  The construction of Capital One  
Arena led to dramatic demographic shifts in Washington DC's Chinatown, and very little  
of the former culture and neighborhood remain.  Opponents of the 76ers arena in Philadelphia  
point to Washington DC's displacement of Chinatown residents and their community as warning.
